title: Types of Data Models
description: The Basics on Types of Data Models
---

In the realm of data modeling, various approaches have emerged to tackle the complexities of organizing and structuring data for effective analysis. This page delves into two prominent types of data models—the Kimball and Inmon methodologies—and provides insights into their characteristics, along with ASCII art ERD diagrams to visually depict each type. Additionally, other types of data models are explored, highlighting their unique attributes, benefits, and drawbacks.

### 1. Kimball Methodology:

**Description:** The Kimball methodology emphasizes dimensional modeling, where data is organized around business processes or events. It focuses on creating data marts, which are subsets of a data warehouse dedicated to specific subject areas.

##### Pros:

- **Simplicity:** Dimensional models are user-friendly and intuitive for business users.
- **Faster Querying:** Optimized for query performance due to pre-aggregated data.
- **Incremental Development:** Data marts can be built individually, allowing for agile development.

##### Cons:

- **Redundancy:** Data marts might lead to redundancy if not managed well.
- **Limited Historical Data:** May not be ideal for historical analysis of long-term trends.

ASCII Art ERD Diagram Example:

```
+------------+         +---------+
| FactSales  |         | DimDate |
+------------+         +---------+
| DateKey    | 1   N   | DateKey |
| ProductKey | <-----> | Date    |
| SalesAmt   |         | ...     |
+------------+         +---------+
```

### 2. Inmon Methodology:

**Description:** The Inmon methodology focuses on creating a centralized data warehouse containing normalized data. Data marts are derived from this warehouse, allowing for consistent, enterprise-wide data integration.

##### Pros:

- **Data Integration:** Provides a consistent source of truth across the organization.
- **Flexibility:** Supports diverse analysis needs by providing normalized data.
- **Long-Term Perspective:** Well-suited for historical trend analysis.

##### Cons:

- **Complexity:** Normalized structures may require complex joins for querying.
- **Performance Overhead:** Querying normalized data can be slower than querying dimensional models.

ASCII Art ERD Diagram Example:

```
+----------+        +-----------+
| Sales    |        | Date      |
+----------+        +-----------+
| SalesID  | 1   N  | DateID    |
| DateID   | <----> | Date      |
| ProductID|        | ...       |
+----------+        +-----------+
```

### 3. Other Types of Data Models:

Description: Beyond Kimball and Inmon, other data modeling methodologies cater to specific needs and scenarios.

**Star Schema:** Similar to Kimball, focuses on central fact tables connected to dimension tables.
**Snowflake Schema:** Builds upon star schema, with dimension tables normalized into sub-dimensions.
**Data Vault:** Designed for scalability, adaptability, and handling changing requirements.

### In Conclusion: Navigating Data Modeling Strategies

The Kimball and Inmon methodologies offer distinct perspectives on data modeling, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of methodology depends on organizational goals, data complexity, and analytical requirements. Additionally, exploring alternative methodologies such as star schema, snowflake schema, and data vault can provide tailored solutions to unique data challenges. Understanding these methodologies equips data professionals with the tools to architect data structures that empower organizations to harness data effectively and drive insightful decision-making.
