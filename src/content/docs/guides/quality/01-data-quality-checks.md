Reliable, accurate data drives confidence in analysis, reporting, and forecasting, shaping the course of an organization's success.

****Accuracy:**** Verifies that data values are correct and align with real-world information.

****Consistency:**** Checks for uniformity in data across various sources and systems.

****Validity:**** Examines data to ensure it conforms to predefined formats, rules, or ranges.

****Timeliness:**** Assesses whether data is up-to-date and aligned with the desired timeframe.

****Uniqueness:**** Identifies and removes duplicate entries to maintain a single version of truth.

****Referential Integrity:**** Validates relationships between data elements, ensuring foreign keys match primary keys.

### Best Practices for Ensuring Data Quality:

**Clearly Define Standards:** Establish clear data quality standards and expectations to guide the assessment process.
