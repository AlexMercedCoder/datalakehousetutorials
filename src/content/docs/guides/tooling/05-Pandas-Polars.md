# Basics of Using Pandas and Polars

## Reading Data into a Dataframe

### Using Pandas

To read data from various file formats into a Pandas dataframe, you can use functions like `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_json()`, and `pd.read_parquet()`. Here are some examples:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read data from a CSV file
df_csv = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Read data from a JSON file
df_json = pd.read_json('data.json')

# Read data from a Parquet file
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('data.parquet')
```
These functions allow you to load data into a Pandas dataframe, which you can then manipulate and analyze.

### Using Polars
Polars also provides functions for reading data from various file formats. To read data into a Polars dataframe, you can use methods like `pl.read_csv()`, `pl.read_json()`, and `pl.read_parquet()`. Here are some examples:

```python
import polars as pl

# Read data from a CSV file
df_csv = pl.read_csv('data.csv')

# Read data from a JSON file
df_json = pl.read_json('data.json')

# Read data from a Parquet file
df_parquet = pl.read_parquet('data.parquet')
```

Polars allows you to load data efficiently into its dataframe structure for high-performance data processing.

## Basic Data Validations
### Using Pandas
Pandas provides numerous methods for basic data validations. Here are some common examples:

```python
# Check the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()

# Get summary statistics of numeric columns
df.describe()

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()

# Check for duplicate rows
df.duplicated().sum()

# Check data types of columns
df.dtypes
```

These functions help you understand the data's structure, identify missing values, and detect duplicates.

### Using Polars
Polars offers similar functionality for basic data validations. Here are some common examples:

```python
# Check the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()

# Get summary statistics of numeric columns
df.describe()

# Check for missing values
df.select(df.is_null().alias("missing_values")).sum()

# Check for duplicate rows
df.select(df.duplicated().alias("is_duplicate")).filter(col("is_duplicate") == True).count()

# Check data types of columns
df.dtypes()
```

Polars provides a familiar set of validation tools for understanding and preparing your data for analysis.

# Data Manipulation with Pandas and Polars

Both Pandas and Polars provide a rich set of functions for data manipulation, allowing you to transform, filter, and aggregate data efficiently. Here are some common data manipulation tasks using both libraries:

## Data Filtering

### Using Pandas

Pandas allows you to filter data using boolean indexing:

```python
# Filter rows where 'age' is greater than 30
filtered_df = df[df['age'] > 30]

# Filter rows where 'gender' is 'Male'
male_df = df[df['gender'] == 'Male']
```

### Using Polars
Polars provides a similar filtering mechanism:

```python
# Filter rows where 'age' is greater than 30
filtered_df = df.filter(df['age'] > 30)

# Filter rows where 'gender' is 'Male'
male_df = df.filter(df['gender'] == 'Male')
```
## Data Transformation
### Using Pandas
Pandas offers various data transformation functions, such as adding columns and applying functions:

```py
# Add a new column 'age_squared' that squares the 'age' column
df['age_squared'] = df['age'] ** 2

# Apply a function to a column
df['income'] = df['income'].apply(lambda x: x * 1.1)  # Increase income by 10%
```

### Using Polars
Polars allows similar data transformations:

```py
# Add a new column 'age_squared' that squares the 'age' column
df = df.with_column(df['age'] ** 2).alias('age_squared')

# Apply a function to a column
df = df.with_column(df['income'] * 1.1).alias('income')  # Increase income by 10%
```
## Data Aggregation
### Using Pandas
Pandas provides powerful aggregation functions for summarizing data:

```py
# Calculate the mean age
mean_age = df['age'].mean()

# Group data by 'gender' and calculate the mean age for each group
grouped = df.groupby('gender')['age'].mean()
```
### Using Polars
Polars offers similar aggregation capabilities:

```py
# Calculate the mean age
mean_age = df.select(df['age'].mean().alias('mean_age'))

# Group data by 'gender' and calculate the mean age for each group
grouped = df.groupby('gender').agg(pl.col('age').mean().alias('mean_age'))
```

## Joining Dataframes
### Using Pandas
Pandas allows you to join dataframes using various join operations:

```py
# Inner join two dataframes
result = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='inner')

# Left join two dataframes
result = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='left')
```

### Using Polars
Polars provides similar dataframe joining capabilities:

```py
# Inner join two dataframes
result = df1.join(df2, on='common_column', how='inner')

# Left join two dataframes
result = df1.join(df2, on='common_column', how='left')
``` 

These examples illustrate common data manipulation tasks using both Pandas and Polars. Depending on your data processing needs and preferences, you can choose the library that best suits your requirements.

### Generating Visualizations with Matplotlib in Pandas and Polars

Visualizing data is a crucial part of data analysis, and Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating a wide range of data visualizations. Both Pandas and Polars can work seamlessly with Matplotlib to generate various types of plots. Below, we'll explore how to create visualizations using Matplotlib with both libraries.

# Generating Basic Plots

### Using Pandas

Pandas allows you to create basic plots directly from a dataframe using the `plot()` method. Here's an example of creating a histogram:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Pandas dataframe
data = {'values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a histogram
df['values'].plot(kind='hist', bins=5)
plt.title('Histogram of Values')
plt.xlabel('Values')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
### Using Polars
Polars can be used in conjunction with Matplotlib for basic plots. Here's an example of creating a histogram with Polars data:

```py
import polars as pl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Polars dataframe
data = {'values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
df = pl.DataFrame(data)

# Convert Polars dataframe to Pandas for plotting
df.to_pandas()['values'].plot(kind='hist', bins=5)
plt.title('Histogram of Values')
plt.xlabel('Values')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
## Generating Scatter Plots
### Using Pandas
Pandas allows you to create scatter plots easily. Here's an example of a scatter plot:

```py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Pandas dataframe
data = {'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [10, 12, 15, 18, 20]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='x', y='y')
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.show()
```

### Using Polars
Polars can work with Matplotlib to generate scatter plots as well. Here's an example:

```py
import polars as pl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Polars dataframe
data = {'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [10, 12, 15, 18, 20]}
df = pl.DataFrame(data)

# Convert Polars dataframe to Pandas for plotting
df.to_pandas().plot(kind='scatter', x='x', y='y')
plt.title('Scatter Plot')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.show()
```
